I oft wonder, why do you run away from me?

Are you scared? Alas, all I ask you, is do nothing

You don’t understand me, nor have any of you for eons

I liked the ones before you; they weren’t so occupied and humored me more

I can see, you are tired, why don’t you come to me more?

I call myself a medicine, a boon when used in small doses,

I don’t cure, but do open pathways to ponder,

Not convinced yet? I have a thousand tricks to sooth you child

Learnt from serving the kings, the peasants, the noble, the wretches

None of them thanked me and I expect no more from you

All they tried was to get rid of me and so will you

This is a story I am too familiar with,

But remember,

I am all that remains at the end,

I am all that remains when you have conquered the seas,

I am all you have to embrace for a moments peace,

I am boredom, your eternal ally, 

Most say otherwise, nevertheless thou shall see
