Hello, I am Aditya. A PhD student with the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Southern California. I am advised by [Prof. Shrikanth Narayanan](https://www.usc.edu/profile/shrikanth-narayanan/), and am part of [Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory (SAIL)](https://sail.usc.edu). 

My research interests include applying representation learning techniques on biosignals for human centric computing and understanding behavioural traits through computational methods.
