Ex: If the random experiment is the roll of a dice, the sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} whereas if the experiment if the toss of a coin, the sample space is {H, T}.</li> <li>Event Space: A subset of the power set of sample space which satisfies the following conditions i.e. the event space is closed under complements, closed under countable unions and contains the sample space.</li> <li>Probability Measure:</li> </ul> </body></html>
