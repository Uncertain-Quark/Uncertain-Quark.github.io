PRECOG: Multimodal integration of neural and biobehavioral signals for predicting preconscious responses is a four year project, supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) as a part of the Neural Evidence Aggregation Tool (NEAT) programme. This project will use modern technology to identify and interpret objective neural and physiological signal biomarkers that can support screening of “preconscious signals” of mental and behavioral health risk factors for conditions such as depression and suicidal ideation.
